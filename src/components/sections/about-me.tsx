            Curious about me? Here you have it:
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            I&apos;m a seasoned full-stack developer specializing in Next.js,
            React.js, and Node.js, with a knack for seamless database
            integration. Beyond development, I am enthusiastic about bringing
            the technical and visual aspects of digital products to life. User
            experience, pixel-perfect design, and writing clear, readable,
            highly performant code matters to me.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            I began my journey as a Software Engineering student (B.Tech IT) at
            Uka Tarsadia University, where I explored full stack development,
            Flutter development, and blockchain development. In my third year,my
            friends and I created a Flutter app called Greenity, which advanced
            us to the SSIP Hackathon finals. Following this, I completed a
            research internship in Blockchain Development, during which I built
            a web3 website named Blockchain-Based Decentralized Research Paper
            Publishing System and wrote a research paper on the project. Now, as
            a graduate with a B.Tech IT degree, I am officially a Software
            Engineer.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            Currently, as a Full Stack Developer, I&apos;m building futuristic
            and advanced websites using modern technologies such as Next.js,
            TypeScript, React.js, Redux, Tailwind CSS, Express.js, Supabase,
            PostgreSQL, Firebase, MongoDB, and many more.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            I am very much a progressive thinker and enjoy working on products
            end to end, from ideation all the way to development.
